# hello-world
<p>baby's first repository (contains a Jupyter notebook and dumb gifs)</p>
<p>we're going places! ðŸŒ´</p>

### Skills I used to make this repository:
- Markdown
- Opening the terminal, getting into a folder and an Anaconda environment, opening a Jupyter notebook
- Installing packages; troubleshooting incompatible versions of things
- Googling; trial and error
- Making Github branches and pull requests
